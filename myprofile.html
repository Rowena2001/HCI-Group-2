                <p>This course gives an understanding of what a modern computer can do. 
                    It covers the internal representation of various data types and focuses 
                    on the architectural components of computers (how these components are 
                    interconnected and the nature of the information flow between them). 
                    Assembly language is used to reinforce these issues.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this course is to provide the students with solid foundations in the basic concepts
                    of programming: Data structures and algorithms. The main objective of the course is to teach the
                    students how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems
                    that they might encounter. This course is also about showing the correctness of algorithms and
                    studying their computational complexities. This course offers the students a mixture of theoretical
                    knowledge and practical experience.
                    <br>The study of data structures and algorithms is carried out within an object-oriented framework.
                    When implementations are considered, the Java programming language is used. Topics covered in
                    this course include:
                    <br>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design and analysis of algorithms
                    <br>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time complexity and asymptotic notation
                    <br>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dictionaries and hash tables
                    <br>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, multi-way search trees, (2,4)-trees, and B-trees
                    <br>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphs, graph traversals, and graph algorithms
                    <br>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorting algorithms.
