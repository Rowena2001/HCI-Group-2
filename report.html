    <!-- Executive Summary -->
    <h1> Executive Summary </h1>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p> Our system of improving DraftMySchedule aims to address the following goals – making clearer constraints when searching and adding courses,  simplifying user interactions when searching for courses, identifying completion of course requirements, and condensing information into one website. 
    </p>

    <h3>Features and Design Principles</h3>
    <p>Through the drop-down menu and buttons, feedback is implemented as the buttons and list items turn a different shade to show users that the buttons are clickable. When a drop-down menu is selected, an accordion of options is displayed for the user to interact with. 
    The navigation bar provides familiarity as it mimics the navigation and menu bars that existing user understand and know how to navigate. 
    The course requirements checklist and progress bar enhances working memory as it provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly and easily input and modify event details, without requiring them to constantly switch between screens or remember complex instructions.
    To demonstrate Hick’s Law, with Quick Add, the application uses historic progressions that users commonly use for their module to suggest courses for students to take. This will decrease the amount of time to make decisions with the number of alternatives.
    Utilizing filters when picking courses accounts for GIGO (garbage in garbage out) as if the user puts in an invalid input for the dropdown, they will get an incorrect output (ie. an incorrect course). 
    The star rating course feature is an example of a virtual metaphor as the act of clicking the amount of stars is a metaphor for the concept of grading and evaluation. 
    Through the see-through interface, a lens is used to display different modalities of data. This is seen when hovering above a course, it will show the past courses and future courses the selected course leads to.
    Using the drag/drop feature achieves the pictorial superiority effect by displaying time slots visually rather than through text.</p>

    <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
    <p>Our team analyzes all 10 of the design heuristics and discover usability insights of individual elements and how the impact the overall user experience.</p>
    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
    <p>In the future, our team sees the improved platform having the following additional capabilities: Display course availability when user clicks on current and other courses, set up direct connection with Student Center, build a better model to predict best Quick Add courses. </p>

    <!-- Design Principles -->
    <h1> Design Principles </h1>

    <h3>Know Thy User</h3>

    <p>As undergraduate students who are primary users of DraftMySchedule, the team utilized personal experiences and pain points to guide discussions on what interactions need to be added or improved. Our team had ongoing feedback sessions as a group to ensure we kept our design user-centered and eliminated as many extra steps and externalities for users. For example, discussing how a Quick Add feature can be designed to be the most beneficial for users as students have limited time and knowledge as to what the course progression is like for future years.</p>



    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>When hovering over buttons and drop-down menus, the buttons and list items turn a different shade to show users that the buttons are clickable. When a drop-down menu is selected, an accordion of options is displayed for the user to interact with. As well, when the add course button is selected, the course block displays in a visual schedule for the user to picture their day.</p>

    <h3>Familiarity</h3>
    <p>The redesign of DraftMySchedule follows the existing UI and color scheme very closely. It mimics the navigation and menu bars that existing user understand and know how to navigate. It also follows mental models of existing navigational bars so individuals know of this centralized are on the top of the page to navigate the site. </p>

      <h3>Progressive Disclosure</h3>

      <p>On the Build Draft page, there are different search bars, filters, and options users can select from through drop-down menus. Since the options are collapsed into a menu that is only discoverable when selected, the options are hidden from the user and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.</p>

      <h3>Working Memory</h3>
      <p>Designing interfaces that reduce the cognitive load on working memory can improve usability and user experience. The redesigned application provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly and easily input and modify event details, without requiring them to constantly switch between screens or remember complex instructions. This is demonstrated through having the course requirements checklist for the users specific module, and having a progress bar to show how many more courses a user may need. This also reduces the number of external applications and websites a user needs to go on to gather information as it centralizes information from the Western site, Student Center, and DraftMySchedule.</p>
      <img src="images/home_hs_cs.png" alt="HSP CS">


      <h3>Gestalt Rules - Common Fate</h3>
      <p>To organize visual information using meaningful patterns, the top menu bar is animated the same way when a user hovers over each section of the bar. This allows the user to understand the elements move together and change in the same way; when one page is selected, it will bring the user to another screen.</p>

      <h3>Hick’s Law</h3>
      <p>Due to the sheer amount of options for course and elective selection, users have to spend a lot of time to make decisions. With Quick Add, the application uses historic progressions that users commonly use for their module to suggest courses for students to take. This will decrease the amount of time to make decisions with the number of alternatives.<b>Refer to the interactive component below and use Quick Add.

        <p>This course provides an overview of a number of areas in human-computer interaction (HCI). Broadly speaking, HCI is an
        interdisciplinary area concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive systems for human use and
        with the study of major phenomena surrounding them. HCI addresses any interaction with computers by humans, as
        developers or as users, as individuals or as groups. On completion of the course, students are expected to have theoretical
        knowledge of and practical experience in the fundamental aspects of designing, implementing, and evaluating interactive
        systems that are useful and usable. Design of usable technology draws extensively on knowledge of informatics, cognition,
        communication, and computation. It is expected that students will become familiar with some of the literature in HCI and
        develop sufficient background in HCI issues to do more advanced work in this area.

        <h3>Visibility and Gulfs of execution and evaluation</h3>
        <p>As designers, we constructed input/output characteristics of the interface to make better matches to psychological needs of the year. In this way, the gulfs of execution and evaluation can be bridged better. To improve visibility, all course selection options are clearly outlined and separated into clearer steps compared to the old version of DraftMySchedule. For execution, the steps have become more efficient as we provide the user additional options to add courses, ie through the Quick Add. For evaluation, we have improved the process of the user determining which courses they can take as our pre-requisite tree clearly outlines what their existing courses can lead to. <b>Refer to the interactive component under Quick Add and test out the button hovering.
        </b></p>

        <h3>Affordances</h3>
        <p>False affordance occurs as currently DraftMySchedule does not take into account if the user can enroll in the course. With our solution, allowing users to add a course to their draft if they have met the requirements. For drafts beyond the present semester, our system will include an additional interaction component, which has users choose their ‘main draft’ for every semester. This ‘main draft’ will be used to track expected progression.</p>

        <h3>Constraints</h3>
        <p>Adding constraints prevents students from adding courses they aren’t eligible for into their draft. By restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment prevents the user from selecting incorrect options and thereby reduces the chance of making a mistake in their course planning. It will help students by provide structure and plan accordingly and prevent intentional errors.
        We used menus (Homepage.moduleB) to manage information complexity so that only necessary or requested information is displayed at any given time. After the subject is chosen, the courses are also grouped into categories to find information easier (ie. first, second year course).
        </p>

        <h3>GIGO (garbage in garbage out)</h3>
        <p>The quality of the output depends on quality of input. As such, if the user puts in an invalid input for the dropdown, they will get an incorrect output. <b>Refer to the interaction under Quick Add.</b></p>

        <h3>Metaphors</h3>
        <p>An example of a skeuomorphic metaphor is the prerequisite tree as it represents an actual tree which shows a path containing which courses can lead to which. 
        An example of a virtual metaphor is clicking stars to rate the course. The act of clicking the amount of stars is a metaphor for the concept of grading and evaluation.

    <h3>Semiotics</h3>
    <p>An example of an iconic symbol is the pencil edit symbol when viewing drafts as this looks like the real representation of a pencil and paper. An example of an indexical symbol is the paper sign beside printer friendly when viewing drafts – the piece of paper signifies that it could be printed. </p>
    <h3>Representation</h3>
    <p>Through the see-through interface, a lens is used to display different modalities of data. This is seen when hovering above a course, it will show the past courses and future courses the selected course leads to. <b>Refer to the interactive component under Quick Add and test out the see-through interface after adding a course.</b></p>
    <h3>Pictorial Superiority Effect</h3>
    <p>Using the drag/drop feature achieves the pictorial superiority effect by displaying time slots visually rather than through text. <b>Refer to the interactive component under Quick Add and test out the drag/drop feature by dragging a course.</b></p>

    <!-- HEURISTIC EVAL -->
    <h1> Heuristic Evaluation</h1>

    <h3>Visibility of System Status</h3>
    <p>The elements of our designs provide immediate feedback to convey the state to the user. When buttons are hovered over, the color is depressed so the user is aware an action is being recognized. When courses are added to the schedule, they appear at the bottom with a time block and a specific color to indicate it has been added. As well, when drop down menus are selected, an accordion of options is listed for the user to select from. There are no actions that require extended delay to accomplish without appropriate feedback. <b>Refer to the interactive component under Quick Add and test out the button hovering.</b></p>


    <h3>Match Between the System and the Real World</h3>
    <p>The system will not have dramatic changes to the typical DraftMySchedule language that students are already familiar with. It will speak the user’s language by using words and phrases that are recognizable to students. This includes using vocabulary that will help navigate creating a schedule such as prerequisite.</p>

    <h3>User Control & Freedom</h3>
    <p>The user has good freedom and is able to select any courses so long as they are offered, they meet the requirements, and have the appropriate prerequisites. The schedule is automatically saved and they are able to continue to come back to it and build upon it. The user is never locked into creating one single schedule and is always free to navigate through the different menu bars and explore other courses.</p>

    <h3>Consistency and Standard </h3>
    <p>The UI follows heavily on mental models that users have developed where you click a button to add a course and it will appear on your schedule. There are also drag and drop functionalities that when interacted with, users can move objects around. Moreover, there are drop down menus and search bars that are consistent with existing mental models. Thus, it conforms to a consistent and standard heuristic as all actions follow the universal standard and are consistent.

    Using a standard color convention achieves internal consistency where users will be able to navigate through buttons. Dark purple buttons are interactive and can be clicked on to perform an action, gray buttons are disabled and thus an action cannot be performed, and light purple will indicate there is a special circumstance where a note is addressed to the user on the side. <b>Refer to the interactive component under Quick Add and test out the drop down buttons and notice the button colours. </b>
    </p>


    <h3>Error Prevention </h3>
    <p>When adding courses to your schedule, our system will gray out the “add course” button so users cannot add courses that they do not have prerequisites for. There is also a lighter purple shade for courses that users have already taken to prevent individuals from duplicating courses. This will enhance the user experience as students will not encounter slips when going through the process of finishing their course plan, but having troubles registering when on Student Center. </p>

    <h3>Recognition vs. Recall in User Interfaces</h3>
    <p>The My Profile menu serves as a constant source of information to reference, allowing the user to refer back to its information and aid in their cognition. The user never has to memorize their courses they have added in their drafts, as it is all referenced in the My Profile tab. <b>Refer to the My Profile tab in the prototype.
    </b></p>

    <h3>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h3>
    <p>There are flexible options to adding courses, such as manually selecting through the dropdown options, or through the “quick add” course suggestions. </p>

    <h3>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
    <p>Our re-design builds on top of the current DraftMySchedule which has an aesthetic and minimalist design, elements that we add also follow the original design. </p>

    <h3>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors</h3>
    <p>On top of error prevention strategies listed above, our re-design makes it intuitive for users to troubleshoot where their errors are coming from and have clear indications through text warnings. </p>

    <h3>Help & Documentation</h3>
    <p>Help & documentation is adequate and sufficient, information is easily-understood, and instructions are adequate for users to execute. Our re-design adheres well to this heuristic.</p>
    <h1> Further Improvements & Recommendations </h1>
      <h3> 1. Display course availability when user clicks on current and other courses </h3>
      <p>  Users will now be able to see real-time updates and plan accordingly based on course availability. Users can also track availability in real-time to add courses as soon as they have vacancies.</p> 
      <h3> 2. Direct connection with Student Center</h3>
      <p>  This way, students will not need to explore and register for courses on 2 different applications and this application will limit externalities.
      <h3> 3. Better model to predict best Quick Add courses</h3>
      <p>  This will encourage individuals not only to follow module progression, but also open it up to electives that meet breadth and depth requirements. Users will be able to indicate interests and the application will find relevant courses that are available during the selected term</p>
