    <h1> Interactive Report </h1>

    <h2> Design Principles </h2>

    <h3>Know Thy User</h3>

    <p>As undergraduate students who are primary users of DraftMySchedule, the team utilized personal experiences and pain points to guide discussions on what interactions need to be added or improved. Our team had ongoing feedback sessions as a group to ensure we kept our design user-centered and eliminated as many extra steps and externalities for users. For example, discussing how a Quick Add feature can be designed to be the most beneficial for users as students have limited time and knowledge as to what the course progression is like for future years.</p>



    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>When hovering over buttons and drop-down menus, the buttons and list items turn a different shade to show users that the buttons are clickable. When a drop-down menu is selected, an accordion of options is displayed for the user to interact with. As well, when the add course button is selected, the course block displays in a visual schedule for the user to picture their day.</p>
    <center>
        <div class="selectdiv">
            <label for="faculty" class="purple"><strong>Please select a faculty:</strong></label>
            <select class="dropdown" name="faculty" id="faculty">
                <option value="science">Science</option>
                <option value="arts">Arts and Humanities</option>
            </select>
        </div>
        <button class="button" onclick="facselect()">Set Faculty</button>
    </center>

    <h3>Familiarity</h3>
    <p>The redesign of DraftMySchedule follows the existing UI and color scheme very closely. It mimics the navigation and menu bars that existing user understand and know how to navigate. It also follows mental models of existing navigational bars so individuals know of this centralized are on the top of the page to navigate the site. </p>


    <center>
    <div class="topnav">
        <a class="active" href="home.html">Home</a>
        <a href="myprofile.html">My Profile</a>
        <a href="builddraft.html">Build Draft</a>
        <a href="myschedule.html">My Schedule</a>

        <a onclick="signout()">Sign Out</a>
        <img src="images/logo.png" class="logo" alt="logo">
    </div>
    </center>

    <h3>Progressive Disclosure</h3>

    <p>On the Build Draft page, there are different search bars, filters, and options users can select from through drop-down menus. Since the options are collapsed into a menu that is only discoverable when selected, the options are hidden from the user and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.</p>

    <h3> INSERT FILTER SEARCH BARS FROM BUILD DRAFT PAGE </h3>

    <h3>Working Memory</h3>
    <p>Designing interfaces that reduce the cognitive load on working memory can improve usability and user experience. The redesigned application provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly and easily input and modify event details, without requiring them to constantly switch between screens or remember complex instructions. This is demonstrated through having the course requirements checklist for the users specific module, and having a progress bar to show how many more courses a user may need. This also reduces the number of external applications and websites a user needs to go on to gather information as it centralizes information from the Western site, Student Center, and DraftMySchedule.</p>
    <img src="images/home_hs_cs.png" alt="HSP CS">


    <h3>Gestalt Rules - Common Fate</h3>
    <p>To organize visual information using meaningful patterns, the top menu bar is animated the same way when a user hovers over each section of the bar. This allows the user to understand the elements move together and change in the same way; when one page is selected, it will bring the user to another screen.</p>

    <h3>Hick’s Law</h3>
    <p>Due to the sheer amount of options for course and elective selection, users have to spend a lot of time to make decisions. With Quick Add, the application uses historic progressions that users commonly use for their module to suggest courses for students to take. This will decrease the amount of time to make decisions with the number of alternatives.</p>

    <h3>INSERT QUICK ADD FEATURE</h3>


    <h1> Heuristic Evaluation</h1>

    <h3>Visibility of System Status</h3>
    <p>The elements of our designs provide immediate feedback to convey the state to the user. When buttons are hovered over, the color is depressed so the user is aware an action is being recognized. When courses are added to the schedule, they appear at the bottom with a time block and a specific color to indicate it has been added. As well, when drop down menus are selected, an accordion of options is listed for the user to select from. There are no actions that require extended delay to accomplish without appropriate feedback.</p>
    <h3> ADD SCHEDULE INTERACTION </h3>


    <h3>Match Between the System and the Real World</h3>
    <p>The system will not have dramatic changes to the typical DraftMySchedule language that students are already familiar with. It will speak the user’s language by using words and phrases that are recognizable to students. This includes using vocabulary that will help navigate creating a schedule such as prerequisite.</p>

    <h3>User Control & Freedom</h3>
    <p>The user has good freedom and is able to select any courses so long as they are offered, they meet the requirements, and have the appropriate prerequisites. The schedule is automatically saved and they are able to continue to come back to it and build upon it. The user is never locked into creating one single schedule and is always free to navigate through the different menu bars and explore other courses.</p>

    <h3>Consistency and Standard </h3>
    <p>The UI follows heavily on mental models that users have developed where you click a button to add a course and it will appear on your schedule. There are also drag and drop functionalities that when interacted with, users can move objects around. Moreover, there are drop down menus and search bars that are consistent with existing mental models. Thus, it conforms to a consistent and standard heuristic as all actions follow the universal standard and are consistent.

        Using a standard color convention achieves internal consistency where users will be able to navigate through buttons. Dark purple buttons are interactive and can be clicked on to perform an action, gray buttons are disabled and thus an action cannot be performed, and light purple will indicate there is a special circumstance where a note is addressed to the user on the side. 
        </p>

        <h3> INSERT DRAG AND DROP</h3>

    <h3>Error Prevention </h3>
    <p>When adding courses to your schedule, our system will gray out the “add course” button so users cannot add courses that they do not have prerequisites for. There is also a lighter purple shade for courses that users have already taken to prevent individuals from duplicating courses. This will enhance the user experience as students will not encounter slips when going through the process of finishing their course plan, but having troubles registering when on Student Center. </p>

    <h3>Recognition vs. Recall in User Interfaces</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h3>
    <p>There are flexible options to adding courses, such as manually selecting through the dropdown options, or through the “quick add” course suggestions. </p>

    <h3>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
    <p>Our re-design builds on top of the current DraftMySchedule which has an aesthetic and minimalist design, elements that we add also follow the original design. </p>

    <h3>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors</h3>
    <p>On top of error prevention strategies listed above, our re-design makes it intuitive for users to troubleshoot where their errors are coming from and have clear indications through text warnings. </p>

    <h3>Help & Documentation</h3>
    <p>Help & documentation is adequate and sufficient, information is easily-understood, and instructions are adequate for users to execute. Our re-design adheres well to this heuristic.</p>
